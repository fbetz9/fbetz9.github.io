  <h1>Disequilibrium Economics</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Disequilibrium Economics, a site dedicated to understanding disequilibrium economics and guiding its usage in analyzing contemporary case studies and economic phenomena.</p>

  <h2>Disequilibrium Economics in Financial Systems</h3>

  <p>Are economies inherently stable or unstable? Are markets (commodity markets and financial markets) inherently perfect or periodically imperfect? For perfection, the traditional equilibrium theory argues for stable economies (due to the ‘invisible hand-of-the-marketplace’); and this is a normative theory, an ‘ideal theory’. But is it true in reality? The historical answer is: sometimes yes and sometimes no. Disequilibrium economics historically appears when markets collapse and bank panics freeze an economy.  In the theory of disequilibrium economics, there are four critical models: (1) model of a financial process, (2) model of price-disequilibrium in a financial market, (3) model of an investment bank process, (4) model of an international financial grid.</p>

      <div class='panel' id='process-panel'>A capital asset is an investment which creates income and can later be sold.  It produces an income stream (present-income) and also can be sold in the future (future-liquidity).  The time dimension is from (T1) of a present-income to (T2) of future-liquidity. This present-to-future (T1 to T2) temporal process occurs in a financial system as a transaction of ‘credit-debt’. A financial market makes the credit-debt contracts sellable, over time, as 'future liquidity'. Thus in a financial sub-system, three things are essential: (1) credit-debt transactions as a fundamental financial process, (2) a capital asset market for liquidity of the asset, and (3) money as a medium of value-exchange.<br />In purely commodity-driven markets debt is not leveraged as a fundamental financial process but as a consequence of a financial process. A fundamental motive for approaching economics this way is because commodities are consumed and are thus short term. The axioms for dealing with commodities, then, are more difficult to apply in a market where its commodities have both present value and future liquidity.</div>

      <div class='panel' id='bubble-panel'>Debt makes a financial process operate. Yet one aspect of debt can destabilize the process; and this is 'leverage', or using debt to finance a purchase of capital assets. This is the financial rationale of 'leverage' -- more ‘present-debt’ toward greater ‘future-wealth’. However, when present-debt is too large, too highly leveraged, it might create bankruptcy. Excessive 'leverage' increases the risk toward bankruptcy and not future-wealth. Irving Fisher had called this financial state of excessive-leverage as 'debt deflation' (Fisher, 1933); and later Hyman Minsky called it ‘Ponzi finance’. (Minsky, 1986).  When a price bubble begins (fueled by leveraged speculation in the future price of an asset), then disequilibrium pricing of the asset can increase and increase -- until the financial bubble bursts.<br />Excessive leverage will always herald a financial bubble. A key part of excessive leverage is speculation: if no speculation occurs in an asset (financial) market then equilibrium prices can remain constant over time. But when price changes in the future are speculated upon on a large enough scale, they necessarily change prices in the present by the change in demand from speculation.</div>

      <div class='panel' id='investment-panel'>How is a bubble created? How is a financial market constructed and operated? We can answer these questions by modeling the system which operates a financial market - the investment bank process. The financial market is composed of financial products created by investment banks. These products match capital supply (demand) in the form of things like venture capital to capital need (supply) in the form of businesses and startups. Investment banks act as the intermediary by creating the products which sell capital assets to buyers. Investment banks serve to compromise the fundamentally different interests of buyers and sellers of financial products. The goal of sellers is to maximize capital on least stringent terms, whereas buyers want to maximize return on investment. Investment banks serve to help buyers and sellers compromise on what terms are fair for the capital sought. The stability of investment banks, then, can depend upon (1) the quantity of financial product purchased and (2) the value of the collateral held on loans to traders. If the market collapses, banks are left with valueless financial products and trader loans.</div>

    <blockquote>Models of modern financial systems have risk in disequilibrium markets at the heart of the systems, as emphasized by Paul McCulley: “At its core, capitalism is all about risk taking. One form of risk taking is leverage. Indeed, without leverage, capitalism could not prosper.... And it is grand while the ever-larger application of leverage puts upward pressure on asset prices.  There is nothing like a bull market to make geniuses out of levered dunces.... [Speculation] begets ever riskier debt arrangements, until they have produced a bubble in asset prices. Then the bubble bursts....” (McCulley, 2009)</blockquote>
    <p>Leveraged ‘present-debt’ can increase ‘future-wealth’, but excessive leverage can lead to bankruptcy. Because of the phenomena of financial bubbles, economic instability is seen by Neo-Keynesians as inherent to economic financial models. For this reason, the Neo-Keynesian School has also been called an ‘endogenous school of economics’ -- instability is indigenous (inside) an economy, through the disequilibrium pricing of asset markets in a financial bubble. They called the Neo-Classical Synthesis School an ‘exogenous' school of economics because they believed all instability was external to an economic system (of perfect markets). Thus arose two views of market-economies:<br /><br />Exogenous School of Economics: Equilibrium-Economics<br />Endogenous School of Economics: Disequilibrium-Economics</p>

      <div class='panel' id='international-panel'>Most of the literature on international capital flows focuses on the issue of whether capital should be allowed to flow freely intand out of a country or should the country try to control the flow. This issue is tied closely to investment banking. While the liberalization of capital flow garners much disagreement, both sides make a common assumption: the "structure" of the banking institutions controlling capital flow has remained unchanged over the course of the twentieth century. With the introduction of information and communications (IC) technologies, banking networks have developed into a kind of grid, drastically changing the way international money flows. Financial markets could operate internationally with ease, outside the jurisdiction of the Security and Exchange Commission, negating the need for U.S. institutions to abide by U.S. rules.</div>

    <p>Historically, the issues about stability and perfection divided the discipline of economics into two schools: exogenous (inherently stable markets) and indogenous (inherently unstable markets). Both of these theories have advantages and disadvantages. Exogenous markets are significantly easier to model: supply and demand control the market and pricing of products is derived from where supply and demand are at equilibrium. These types of markets fail, however, when any kind of economic upset occurs.</p>
    <blockquote>It’s hard to believe now, but not long ago economists were congratulating themselves over the success of their field. Those successes — or so they believed — were both theoretical and practical, leading to a golden era for the profession.... Few economists saw the 2008 crisis coming, but this predictive failure was the least of the field’s problems. More important was the profession’s blindness to the very possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy....” (Krugman, 2009)</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Reworking of economic models should be based upon history and more broadly based.... There should be more teaching of economic history.... The study of economics should be set in a broader political context.... But it is not clear that a majority of the profession yet accepts even these modest proposals. The so-called ‘Chicago School’ has mounted a robust defense of its rational-expectations-based approach, rejecting the notion that a rethink is required.  The Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas has argued that the crisis was not predicted because economic theory predicts that such events cannot be predicted. So all is well.” (Davies, 2012)</blockquote>
    <p>As taught in traditional economics, the Neo-Classical Synthesis School focused upon market-perfection as a model of a supply-demand curve of equilibrium pricing in an economy.  This is a normative theory, a desirable performance in a market. No government control over pricing is necessary, as a supply-demand equilibrium in the market sets the optimal price for the public good.   However, was the equilibrium model always valid empirically for financial markets?  Not in 2007. For example, this theory was earlier used by Allen Greenspan in 2000 to argue against regulations on the derivative markets, which, in fact, did later collapse financial markets in the global crisis of 2007-08.</p>
    <p>Neo-Keynesians argued that the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists had too narrowly viewed an economy as only a production system. For example, Ben Bernanke wrote: <q>Economists have not always fully appreciated the importance of a healthy financial system for economic growth or the role of financial conditions in short-term economic dynamics....</q> (Bernanke, 2007)</p>
    <blockquote>“Ben Bernanke pointed out that the dominant microeconomic paradigm is an equilibrium construct... that determines relative prices.... [The assumption is that] money and financial interrelations are not relevant to the determination of these equilibrium variables.... But if the basic microeconomic model is opened to include yesterdays, todays, and tomorrows...." (Minsky, 1993)</blockquote>
    <p>And earlier, Minsky had argued that introducing a time dimension into economic models was very important to the reality of an economy.</p>
    <blockquote>"In the General Theory, Keynes sought to create a model of the economy in which money is never neutral (to pricing).  He did this by creating a model... in which the price level of financial... assets is determined in [financial] markets.... Each capital and financial asset yields an income stream, (which) has carrying costs and possessing some degree of liquidity.... The price level of assets is determined by the relative value... [of] income... and liquidity...." (Minsky, 1993)</blockquote>
    <p>Time dependence in a Keynes' model of a financial system lies in the concepts of a "present-income" and a "future-liquidity" of a "capital asset".</p>
