	<p>Disequilibrium economics is a growing field and we are always looking for collabortors and contributors. If you are currently researching disequilibrium economics and have other articles you would like to recommend, or if you have any comments that you think would improve the quality of this site, please contact us and we would be happy to have your input. We are publishing papers regularly and are looking for case study opportunities to expand the theory behind disequilibrium economics, and believe that many hands make more thorough and credible work.</p>
